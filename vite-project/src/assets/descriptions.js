The goal was to implement a node-link-diagram where the nodes represent keywords that were used in the publications, and the links are keywords that are used in the same publications. The node size encodes the number of publications using the keyword. I implemented a click interaction that lists the publications using a selected keyword. The graph layout was achieved using d3-force. Furthermore, the data was filtered so that only the nodes and links above a certain size limit are displayed.",

The goal was to visualize the movies by the 15 directors who had directed the most movies, as well as 3 additional variables. I chose to symbolize the movie genre by color and the profitability of a movie by two overlaying circles. Furthermore, I implemented a hover interaction (showing details to the selected movie) and a click interaction (highlighting movies of the same genre).",
