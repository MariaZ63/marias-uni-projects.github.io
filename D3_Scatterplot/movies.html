    <h2>Observed Insights:</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Action movies and adventure movies appear to have a considerably bigger worldwide gross than other genres. For example, the most successful movie, Jurassic Park, has a worldwide gross of 923,067,947 US Dollars â€“ and it is an action movie. These genres also are among the most frequent.</li>
        <li>Production budgets of all movies are rather similar. They all have grown bigger over time: In the early years (roughly until 1990), they ranged from around 10 million US dollars up to 50 million US dollars. In later years (around 2010), most of the movies cost more than 50 million US dollars, many even over 100 million US dollars. This may be a byproduct of inflation. But it is also possible that the success of the directors has led them to be granted a bigger budget.</li>
    </ul>
