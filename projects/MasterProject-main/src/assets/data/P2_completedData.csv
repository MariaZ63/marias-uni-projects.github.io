The Midnight Library,Matt Haig,,Canongate Books Ltd.,9781786892720,54789601,paperback,read,2022/12/03,4.0,"<div>I feel conflicted about this book. So far, I've enjoyed Matt Haig's non-fiction more than his fiction, and I think I might have liked reading about the ideas he presents in this novel more if he'd gone with non-fiction again. There's a clear message about life here, so much so that&nbsp; &lt;spoiler&gt;you pretty much know how the book is gonna end from page one because any other ending would run counter to that message.&lt;/spoiler&gt; So take those ideas and put them in a non-fiction book where none of the Quotable Lines and Explicitly Spelled Out Life Lessons will feel out of place, and we're good! As it is, the writing sometimes felt clunky and weighed down (and generally would have benefited from another round of editing to take out some bits where the same thing is said twice, as if the author had wanted to give himself options and then forgot to pick one) and for a long time, I worried that the plot would become incredibly repetitive, with most of the drive to keep reading coming from &lt;spoiler&gt;wanting to know how each new life was secretly also bad&lt;/spoiler&gt;. But then halfway through, the book did manage to properly engage me and I finished it over the course of one morning, which I'm pretty sure is the longest consecutive amount of time I've spend reading in years. So I figure Matt Haig must have done something right there! And there were some details that contributed to how the story ended (&lt;spoiler&gt;Nora seeing the positive impact she'd had on her community - her neighbour and her piano student&lt;/spoiler&gt;) that I didn't see coming and liked a lot.<br><br>My biggest issue was with the execution of the central mechanic though. I realise that a lot of my issues with this are thanks to me overthinking aspects of the book that probably <em>just weren't the point</em>, so I ultimately decided not to let them influence my rating too much, but I need to write them out to get them out of my head. &lt;spoiler&gt;Okay, so between life and death you get to try out other lives to see if there’s one you’d rather be living, and if you find one you like, you get to stay there. Except you’re thrown into each life without any new memories. You inhabit the body of this alternate you, but apparently some magic science makes it so the make-up of your brain stays exactly the same. I get this as a plot device - Nora slowly untangles the details of each new life she tries out, finding out more about who she is there and what problems this version of herself is dealing with. But if you put me in that position, it would be anxiety central.<br><em>How could you be happy in any other life if you were unceremoniously dumped into it with the same memories and outlook you had when you decided to die? Even if those other lives were actually perfect, how could you be happy in a life with a partner if you couldn't remember the growth you'd been through together? How could you be happy in a life with an exciting job if you couldn't remember the knowledge and skills you needed to do it? How could you be happy in a life where you'd been through new grief or trauma if you </em>c<em>ouldn't remember if you'd already healed from it at all? How could you be happy in a life that doesn't match your current values if you couldn't remember the journey that got you there? How could you be happy in </em><strong><em>any</em></strong><em> life if every social interaction was a minefield because you had to pretend to know who others were or what they were talking about, and if you lacked the context of how you' grown into the person that was living this life?<br></em>It's later shown that if you stay in a life long enough, memories from that life will start to come back. But that doesn't solve the initial problem, which is that ""any conversation could end in you accidentally insulting or hurting the other person, and also you have to feign professional competence that you do not have"" sounds exactly like a good 50% of my stress dreams.<br>And I guess that's the point. That the life you'd want to live isn't any of those other lives but your own, because that life is what shaped you into the person you are now. But if this library could truly give you a chance to discover if other life choices might have been better, it would let you <em>feel</em> what it's actually like to live those lives, not just watch them through the eyes of an alternate you.<br><br>The <em>other</em> thing that bugged me was that I kept feeling sorry for the versions of Nora that presumably had to take over again once she'd decided against her life, with no clear memory of what they'd been doing or why. I had to decide that once Nora visited a life, that decision created one universe in which she hadn't made the decision to visit and that life's original Nora got to live her own life in its entirety, undisturbed by all of this, and one universe in which protagonist-Nora took over - and that this latter universe then split into two parallel universes again at the moment of decision - one universe that we got to see in the novel, in which she was disappointed and returned to the library at that moment, and another universe in which that exact moment was the one in which she decided that this was the life she was content with, and started forgetting about the library. Sshhh I'm right. That must be how it works. I have to tell myself that, or else I'd get incredibly annoyed at Nora for stealing (sometimes quite big!) chunks of time from her other selves and fucking up their lives in the process.&lt;/spoiler&gt;</div>",Yes,288,2020,2020,3.99,United Kingdom,male,English,Fiction

They Both Die at the End,Adam Silvera,"Michael Crouch (Narrator), Robbie Daymond (Narrator), Bahni Turpin (Narrator)",HarperCollins Publishing and Blackstone Audio,9781538456903,36412949,audio,read,2022/01/07,3.0,"<div>&nbsp;<em>&lt;spoiler&gt;</em> Right. I will say that this book is a good example of the idea of interest in a story not being based on how it ends but on how it gets there, because I definitely made my way through the audiobook much quicker than I usually do, wanting to find out more about how exactly the protagonists' story was going to end. How much of my investment in the main characters' fates was thanks to the writing and how much of it was thanks to their respective audiobook narrators doing a good job? I can't tell.<br><br>That said, while I enjoyed the chapters told from the POV of the two protagonists, there were also many chapters with other POVs that I found worthwhile to, let's say, varying degrees. The chapters focusing on side characters like friends of the protagonists who had been introduced previously were nice enough, but many of the others felt like I just wanted to get through them and return to the main plot as quickly as possible. There was a whole secondary narrative about a journalist who doesn't believe her alert that she's dying that day is real, and a celebrity also due to die that she wants to interview, which I really felt added very, very little to the story all the way through. I expected her fate to be cleverly tied to at least one of the protagonists' deaths, and it kind of was, but not in a way that really justifies the presence of this side plot at all. Rufus could have been hit by just about any car; I don't see how that would have made a difference.<br><br>Also, I honestly still can't quite take the world building seriously. There was some attempt to explore how society would change if people knew they were going to die on the day it was due to happen, but I didn't feel like it was quite thought through enough, and thinking about that distracted me from the story more than once. The book addresses the logical questions of its premise with remarks like ""well, no one knows how it works!"" I guess I'm just not quite ready to embrace that ambiguity.<em>&lt;/spoiler&gt;</em>&nbsp;</div>",No,1,2017,2017,3.76,United States of America,male,English,Young Adult
