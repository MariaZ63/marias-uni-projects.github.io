# Project Name
Mind the Gap -
Bachelorproject of the Information Visualization Chair about Enriched Data Comics 

## Introduction
We created an enriched interactive data comic on a webpage about the gender data gap.
The aim of this project is to educate a broad audience about the gender data gap and 
especially address a non-scientific audience. We wanted to break down the complex topic into a relatable story
and raise awareness of the issue and furthermore evoke further interest in the topic. 
To make this issue available to a broad audience we decided to do a webpage instead of a physical comic. 

## Features
- Interactive webpage about the gender data gap 
- Data visualizations showing information based on scientific studies and literature
- Sound and video additions 
- Details on demand
- Further informaton about the data gap in general

## Installation
To start the webpage, doubleclick on "Intro.html". There will be played a title music when the page is opened. 
We recommend the firefox browser in order to experience all functionalities of the comic. 

## Usage
At the end of each story you can can switch to the next story by clicking on a respective button. 
In addition there is a navigation at the bottom of each page to switch between pages. 
Interaction possibilities are highlightes with a yellow shine around the clickable object or a tooltip.
All references are listed on the final part of the comic, the references page. 
Individual sources of the comic strips are visible by hovering over the infobuttons on the bottom right in the respective panels. 
Clicking on items that are highlighted yellow will initiate interactions or reveal additional information. 
Additional information can be hidden by clicking the x-Button or clicking on the respective panel.

## Troubleshooting 
### If the title melody is not played:
	- You might need to allow the playback of audio and video within your browser's setting. 
	  Here you'll find an explanation on how to do that in firefox: https://support.mozilla.org/de/kb/automatische-tonwiedergabe-erlauben-bzw-blockieren
	- Try another browser such as Chrome or Edge (you might need to allow the audio playback here as well).
### If the comic strips are cut and not fully shown: 
	- Just zoom and pan until the panels are fully visible
