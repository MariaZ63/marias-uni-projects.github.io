        <h3>Data comic</h3>
        <p>During an information visualization project in winter semester 2022/23, I created this comic with two fellow
          students. I was responsible
          for all the drawings, as well as the research, storytelling and implementation of the part about <a

        <h3>d3 Scatterplot</h3>
        <p>As a graded assignment for a information visualization class, I received a dataset about movies. The task was
          to implement a visualization from scratch, using d3.js. The goal was to visualize the movies by the 15
          directors who had directed the most movies, as well as 3 additional variables. I chose to symbolize the movie
          genre by color and the profitability of a movie by two overlaying circles. Furthermore, I implemented a hover
          interaction (showing details to the selected movie) and a click interaction (highlighting movies of the same
          genre).</p>

        <h3>d3 Graph Visualization</h3>
        <p>This was another graded assignment for my information visualization class. The base was a dataset about
          publications. The goal was to implement a node-link-diagram where the nodes represent keywords that were used
          in the publications, and the links are keywords that are used in the same publications. The node size encodes
          the number of publications using the keyword. I implemented a click interaction that lists the publications
          using a selected keyword. The graph layout was achieved using d3-force. Furthermore, the data was filtered so
          that only the nodes and links above a certain size limit are displayed.</p>

        <h3>Single Page Application</h3>
        <p>As an assignment for a class on web technologies, three fellow students and I were tasked to develop a single
          page application for the fictional research project "GOTO Mars Research", displaying their data about rocket
          missions to Mars. We implemented an API that allows the client to fetch the JSON data and use it for a counter
          and a visualization.</p>
